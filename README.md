splitCSV.py is a `<python script>` that basically allows `<Data Analysts>` to split large CSVs based on provided row size. 

Function: main is a method that splits the xlxs file to multiple CSVs based on provided row size.
Variables: 
1. <filename> - filepath/name of a Excel file. Eg: '~/Desktop/test.xlsx' Or if file is in same path as this script simply 'test.xlsx'
2. <rowsize> - size of a row you want to split the Excel file to create multiple CSVs.  
3. <output_file_prefix> - output file prefix. Eg. If you provide 'result' then file name will be result_1.csv, result_2.csv ... 
    
Steps:
1. Load Excel file and create a dataframe using python library pandas
2. Split the dataframe to list/array of dataframes based on the row size you provided
3. Loop through the list to create multiple CSVs. 
    
All the CSVs are saved inside Output folder.
